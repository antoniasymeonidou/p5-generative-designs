Roses are red
Violets are blue
This is a poem for CSS
And it's been created only for you

Love for CSS it feels weird
It has Passion, Love and Hate
But if your stong enough
CSS will be no more pain

If your code is crazy
And you can't do a thing
CSS is there to hold your hand
Forever, Always, CSS will arrange
